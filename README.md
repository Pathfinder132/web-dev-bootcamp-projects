# Web Development Bootcamp Projects

These are the mini-projects and practice tasks I worked on while going through Angela Yuâ€™s **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** on Udemy.

Iâ€™ve included sections where I actually built something worthwhile â€” HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects that helped me understand the basics of frontend development.

## ðŸ“‚ Sections Included

- **Section 2â€“4** â€“ Basic HTML  
  Learned about HTML structure, elements, and forms. Made a few small projects to practice page layouts and semantic tags.

- **Section 5â€“9** â€“ CSS  
  Covered styling basics, flexbox, grid, and responsive design. Built a bunch of mini projects to apply these concepts.

- **Section 18** â€“ JavaScript  
  Got into DOM manipulation, events, and basic scripting. Added interactivity to small projects.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Responsive Design)  
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Events, Basic Logic)

## Note
For most tasks, the course gave starter code. My part was writing the logic for that section to complete the project.
